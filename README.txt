Any usage instructions:
From the main activity, decide whether you will be host or client.

Host is taken to a queue which is the music queue that is played to all the clients in order.
The add button on the bottom allows the host to add more music from his local file system into the queue.

Client is taken straight to a music player interface where he listens to the music that the Host determined in his queue.

Known bugs:
Not that the team is aware of.

Areas you would like feedback on:
Does the flow for host and client make sense?
Is the queueing system convenient way to add music for the host?
